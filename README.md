# OpenGL-3D-Engine
A 3D engine using OpenGL - In development

This is my first attempt at building a working engine. Expect many bad practices as I figure out how to display anything on the screen.

Overall goal for this project is to generate terrain(Grass/Trees/Water) and object model loading(Buildings). Additionally implement different lighting techniques to the world. 

Feel free to follow my progress on my website as I post updates to my application!

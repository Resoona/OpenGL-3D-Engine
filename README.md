# OpenGL-3D-Engine
A 3D engine using OpenGL - In development

This is my first attempt at building a working engine. Expect many bad practices as I figure out how to display anything on the screen.

Overall goal for this project is to generate terrain and object model loading. Post Process Effects to be added afterwards.

Feel free to follow my progress on my website as I post updates to my application!
